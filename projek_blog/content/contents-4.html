                                The most familiar type of job interview, the traditional one-on-one format typically involves HR representatives and key
                                decision-makers asking questions in a question-and-answer session. Here are some examples of common questions asked
                                during traditional interviews: <br>
                                "Tell me about yourself." <br>

                                highlights your relevant skills and experiences. <br>
                                
                                "Why do you want this job?" <br>
